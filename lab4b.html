UNIVERSITY</h2></font>
Located in the town of Rajgir [ancient 
Imperial capital city] in the northern 
province of Bihar in India, Nalanda 
University is a post-graduate, researchintensive international university 
established on 25th November 2010, 
as “an institution of national 
importance”, by a special Act [No. 39 
of 2010] of the Parliament of India, 
aiming to revive the erstwhile 
renowned ancient seat of learning, 
which thrived from 5th century CE to 
12th century CE, as the first residential 
university of the world.
<br>
<br>
The rejuvenation of ancient Nalanda 
was proposed by former President 
Late Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam. The 
member states attending the East Asia 
Summits [Cebu, 2007 and Hua Hin, 
2009], also sought the revival of the 
ancient Nalanda to “improve regional 
understanding and appreciation of one 
another’s heritage and history; to 
strengthen regional educational 
cooperation; and to build a community 
of learning which symbolises the 
spirituality that unites all mankind.” 
Other countries of the world have also 
signed intergovernmental memoranda 
of understanding to support the 
Nalanda University.
